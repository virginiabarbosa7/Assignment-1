      <h3>Many candidates, few with real chances</h3>
      <h4>The Brazilian elections has two rounds in October, one in the beginning and another in the end of the month.</h4>
      <h4>There are currently 13 candidates in the Brazilian Presidential elections, and polls have shown that only two of them have real chances.</h4>
      <h4>One is an extreme-right wing deputy, Jair Bolsonaro, which some speculate he can bring back an authoritarian regime. The other, Fernando Haddad, is a left-wing politician that was part of the previous government which led Brazil to its current financial crisis.</h4>
